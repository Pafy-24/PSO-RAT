# PSO-RAT

This repository contains two small C++ projects:

- `RAT-Server` — a simple POSIX TCP server that accepts one connection, sends a welcome message, echoes one message, then closes the connection.
- `RAT-Client` — a simple POSIX TCP client that connects to the server, reads the welcome message, sends a message and prints the echo.
